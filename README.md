Home Page Instr:

Create a course PAGE --> New Page: Fill out the fields for: Course name + number, Instructor Name, Description, Materials (Menu of videos, books needed, readings), button to add a new assignment, as well as upload an answer key to the assignment. 

(a unique number
a course name
a non-empty set of instructors
a roster of students

Maybe make edit functionality, that brings you back to submission form and lets you continue from where you left off when making the course.

Button inside Course page that has a table list of Instructors added to the course. Plus sign to add a new instructor, minus to delete instructor.


My Courses page:
- Prof can see all assignments. Click on an assignment brings you to a page where you have a list of students who have submissions, as well as a tab for a list of all students enrolled in the course, at the bottom there will be a section for students who applied for the course, and you can hit approve or reject for those students. The main tab (Submissions Tab) you can see a list of students who have submissions. Clicking that brings you to a new page that shows the submission (from a given student, whether draft or full submission, and there will be a small title if draft or not). There will be several buttons. One pulls up the answer key associated with the assignment. Each question has two buttons next to it, a check and an x, that the prof can click.  At the bottom of each Assignment Page, there is a Feedback text box as well as a Grade [0/100] Textbox Range. Make a button on the top right of page that Deletes the users submission, and allows them to resubmit.

Footer is always there, and it gives a contact page, which has both Amna’s and Ben’s emails and GitHub links
